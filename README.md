# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains code I used in studying different data structures and algorithm. 
It also contains the BIG O notation for each data structure and algorithm (Time and Space Complexities)

#### Data Structures Learnt
- Arrays (Static and Dynamic)
- Hash Tables (Objects)
- Linked List (Singly and Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees)
- Graphs

#### Algorithms Learnt 
- Recursion (Although this isn't really an algorithm)
- Sorting
- Searching (Breadth First Search + Depth First Search)
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization)
